# Braid Incident Response Documentation [![Build Status](https://circleci.com/gh/PagerDuty/incident-response-docs/tree/master.svg?style=svg)](https://circleci.com/gh/PagerDuty/incident-response-docs)
This is a public version of the Incident Response process used at Braid. It is also used to prepare new employees for on-call responsibilities, and provides information not only on preparing for an incident, but also what to do during and after. See the [about page](docs/about.md) for more information on what this documentation is and why it exists.

This process is forked and adopted from [PagerDuty](https://github.com/PagerDuty/incident-response-docs)., to whom we are eternally grateful.
